The `showSlides` function is responsible for managing the transition of slides in the slider. 
I'm explaining, step by step, below:

```javascript
function showSlides() {
    slideIndex++; // Move to the next slide.
    if (slideIndex >= slides.length) { 
        slideIndex = 0; // If we reach the end, loop back to the first slide.
    }
    // Update the transform property to slide
    slider.style.transform = `translateX(-${slideIndex * 100}%)`;
}

```
1. Incrementing the Slide Index:
   ```javascript
   slideIndex++;
   
   - `slideIndex` is a counter that keeps track of the currently visible slide.
   - It starts at `0` (the first slide) and increments by 1 every time `showSlides` is called.

2. Resetting the Slide Index:

   ```javascript
   if (slideIndex >= slides.length) {
       slideIndex = 0;
   }
   
   - If `slideIndex` exceeds the total number of slides (`slides.length`), it resets to `0`.
   - This ensures the slider loops back to the first slide after displaying the last slide.

3. Sliding the Container:
   ```javascript
   slider.style.transform = `translateX(-${slideIndex * 100}%)`;

   - The `transform` property applies a translation (movement) to the `slider` element along the X-axis.
   - `translateX(-${slideIndex * 100}%)` calculates how far to slide the container based on the current slide:
     - `slideIndex = 0` → `translateX(0%)` (First slide).
     - `slideIndex = 1` → `translateX(-100%)` (Second slide).
     - `slideIndex = 2` → `translateX(-200%)` (Third slide).

   - Negative values move the container to the left, effectively showing the next slide.

How It Works in This Context
1. The `.slider` element contains all the slides laid out horizontally using `flexbox`. Each slide takes up `100%` of the container width.
   ```css
   .slider {
       display: flex;
       width: 300%; /* Enough width to contain all slides */
       transition: transform 0.5s ease-in-out; /* Smooth sliding effect */
   }
   ```

2. By adjusting `translateX` on the `.slider` element, the visible portion of the slider container shifts to show a different slide.

3. The function `showSlides` is called repeatedly (e.g., using `setTimeout`), ensuring the slider automatically transitions through the slides.


Why This Works for Your Slider
- Sliding Effect: The `transform` property achieves a smooth, container-bound sliding effect.
- Looping Logic: The reset of `slideIndex` ensures the slider loops seamlessly from the last slide back to the first.
- Responsive Design: Because each slide takes up `100%` of the container, the sliding effect works perfectly regardless of screen size.

Illustration of Sliding
- Imagine you have 3 slides:
  - Slide 1 (Index 0) is shown initially.
  - The container slides to the left by `-100%` for Slide 2 (Index 1).
  - Another `-100%` shift for Slide 3 (Index 2).
  - After reaching Slide 3, the index resets, and the container slides back to `0%`.
